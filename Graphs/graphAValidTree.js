    Is It A Tree

    Given an undirected graph of node_count nodes and edge_count edges,
    find whether it is a tree or not. The undirected edges are described
    by two arrays edge_start and edge_end of size edge_count each. There
    exists an undirected edge between the node labeled edge_start[i] and the
    node labeled edge_end[i] for all valid i. 

    Example One

    Input: 

    node_count = 4, edge_start = [0, 0, 0], edge_end = [1, 2, 3]

    Output: true

    This graph is a valid tree because all the nodes are connected and it does not have any cycle.
